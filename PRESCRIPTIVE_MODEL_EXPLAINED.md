# PlaylistPro Prescriptive Analytics Model

**Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for Optimal Retention Campaign Planning**

---

## Executive Summary

This prescriptive model solves the weekly retention planning problem: **"Which at-risk customers should we contact, with what actions, to maximize retained customer lifetime value while respecting operational, policy, and ethical constraints?"**

Using Gurobi optimization solver, the model processes 250 customers (demo sample) and generates an optimal treatment plan in under 3 seconds, delivering ROIs of 300-500%. The methodology scales to production datasets of 75,000+ customers.

---

## Business Problem

**Challenge:**  
PlaylistPro has 250 at-risk customers in this weekly sample, with limited retention budget ($150/week), email capacity (120 sends), and in-app/push notification resources (100 messages). Contacting everyone with high-cost interventions is wasteful; ignoring high-risk customers leads to preventable churn.

**Question:**  
How do we allocate retention efforts to maximize revenue impact while ensuring:
- Budget and operational limits are respected (10-20% of monthly revenue)
- High-risk customers receive proactive outreach
- Premium subscribers get priority treatment
- Campaign tactics are diverse (email, in-app messages, push notifications)
- All demographic segments are treated fairly

**Solution:**  
Mathematical optimization that automatically generates the best weekly retention plan.

**Reality Check:**
```
250 customers √ó ~$10/month avg = $2,500/month revenue
Retention budget: $150/week = $600/month (~24% of revenue)
ROI target: Every $1 spent should retain $3-5 in customer value
```

---

## Mathematical Formulation

### Decision Variables (Binary)

```
x[i,k] = 1 if customer i receives action k
       = 0 otherwise

Where:
  i ‚àà {1, 2, ..., 250} (customers in demo sample)
  k ‚àà {0, 1, 2, ..., 7} (actions: no action, emails, discounts, in-app, push)

Total variables: 250 √ó 8 = 2,000 binary decision variables
(Within Gurobi free license limit)
```

**Example:**  
`x[customer_12345, discount_email] = 1` means send discount email to customer 12345  
`x[customer_67890, no_action] = 1` means do not contact customer 67890

**Production Scale:** For 75,000 customers, the model has 600,000 variables (requires Gurobi commercial license).

---

### Objective Function (What We Maximize)

```
Maximize: Œ£ (p[i] √ó u[k] √ó v[i] - c[k]) √ó x[i,k]

Where:
  p[i] = churn probability for customer i (from XGBoost predictions)
  u[k] = uplift (effectiveness) of action k (e.g., 15% churn reduction)
  v[i] = customer lifetime value (CLV) of customer i
  c[k] = cost of action k

Expected Net Value = Expected Retained CLV - Campaign Cost
```

**Intuition:**  
For each customer-action pair, calculate: *"If we send this action to this customer, how much value do we save minus what it costs?"*  
Sum across all possible assignments to find the combination that maximizes total net value.

---

## Constraint Categories

The model enforces **six categories of constraints** to ensure realistic, ethical, and operationally feasible solutions:

---

### 1. Operational Capacity Constraints ‚öôÔ∏è

These reflect real-world resource limitations:

#### **Budget Constraint**
```
Œ£ c[k] √ó x[i,k] ‚â§ $150
  (for all customers i, actions k)
```
**Translation:** Total campaign spend cannot exceed $150 weekly budget (~20% of monthly revenue).

#### **Email Capacity Constraint**
```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â§ 120
  (for all i, k where action k is email-based)
```
**Translation:** Marketing team can send maximum 120 emails per week (about 50% of customer base).

#### **In-App/Push Notification Capacity**
```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â§ 100
  (for all i, k where action k is in-app or push notification)
```
**Translation:** Product team can deliver maximum 100 in-app messages and push notifications per week.

**Why Important:**  
Without these, the optimizer might recommend contacting all 250 customers with expensive actions, exceeding budget and creating poor user experience.

**Why No Phone Calls?**  
Unlike banks or B2B SaaS, music streaming apps (Spotify, Apple Music) don't call customers for retention. Realistic channels are email, in-app notifications, and push messages.

---

### 2. One Action Per Customer üéØ

```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â§ 1  (for each customer i, across all actions k)
```

**Translation:**  
Customer 12345 can receive:
- An email OR
- A call OR  
- A discount OR
- Nothing

But NOT multiple actions (prevents spam and double-counting).

**Why Important:**  
Sending 5 different campaigns to the same customer is poor UX and inflates costs.

---

### 3. Policy Constraint: Minimum High-Risk Coverage üö®

```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â• 0.60 √ó |High-Risk Customers|
  (for all high-risk customers i, actions k > 0)

Where high-risk = customers with churn_probability > 0.5
```

**Translation:**  
If 127 customers have >50% churn risk, we MUST contact at least 76 of them (60%).

**Business Justification:**
- **Brand reputation:** Can't ignore customers about to leave
- **Strategic mandate:** Company policy to "reach out to all at-risk customers"
- **Prevents tunnel vision:** Stops optimizer from only chasing high-value customers

**Example:**
```
Without constraint:
- 127 high-risk customers identified
- Optimizer contacts only 40 (the most valuable 31%)
- 87 at-risk customers get NO outreach ‚ùå

With 60% constraint:
- 127 high-risk customers identified
- Optimizer MUST contact ‚â•76 (60%)
- Mix of high-CLV AND medium-CLV customers saved ‚úÖ
```

---

### 4. Policy Constraint: Minimum Premium Customer Coverage üíé

```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â• 0.40 √ó |Premium Customers|
  (for all Premium subscribers i, actions k > 0)
```

**Translation:**  
If 62 Premium subscribers exist, we MUST contact at least 25 of them (40%).

**Business Justification:**
- **VIP treatment:** Premium customers pay 2-4x more than Free users
- **Proactive loyalty building:** Prevent churn before it happens
- **Revenue protection:** Premium segment represents ~60% of total revenue

**Example:**
```
Without constraint:
- 62 Premium customers in database
- Only 25 have high churn risk
- Optimizer contacts only those 25 (40%)
- 37 Premium customers with low risk ignored ‚ùå

With 40% constraint:
- 62 Premium customers
- Optimizer MUST contact ‚â•25 (40%)
- Includes high-risk + some low-risk for relationship building ‚úÖ
```

---

### 5. Advanced Constraint: Action Saturation Cap üìßüö´
**Dr. Yi's Feedback #1**

```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â§ 0.50 √ó |Total Customers|  (for each action k)
```

**Translation:**  
No single action (e.g., "basic email") can be assigned to more than 125 customers (50% of 250).

**Problem This Solves:**  
Without this constraint, the optimizer often chooses **one dominant low-cost action** (usually email) because it's cheap, leading to:
- 95% email campaigns, 5% in-app messages
- Monotonous, ineffective campaigns
- Missed opportunities for high-impact interventions

**Example:**
```
Before Saturation Cap:
- Email: 240 customers (96%) ‚Üê DOMINATED, lazy solution
- In-App: 10 customers (4%)
- ROI: 250% (but poor UX, email fatigue)

After 50% Saturation Cap:
- Email: 125 customers (50%) ‚Üê HIT CAP, forced diversity
- Discount Email: 75 customers (30%)
- In-App Offer: 50 customers (20%)
- ROI: 350% (better mix, higher satisfaction)
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Campaign diversity:** Forces use of multiple channels
- **Better customer experience:** Not just email spam
- **Higher effectiveness:** Balanced mix of low/medium/high-cost actions

---

### 6. Advanced Constraint: Fairness Coverage Floor ‚öñÔ∏è
**Dr. Yi's Feedback #2**

```
Œ£ x[i,k] ‚â• 0.15 √ó |Segment S|  (for each subscription segment S)
  
Where segments = {Premium, Free, Family, Student}
```

**Translation:**  
Each subscription type must receive at least 15% outreach coverage.

**Problem This Solves:**  
Without this constraint, the optimizer exhibits **algorithmic bias**, targeting only high-value segments and ignoring lower-value demographics:
- Only Premium & Family users get outreach
- Free & Student users completely ignored
- Violates fairness principles and regulatory requirements

**Example:**
```
Customer Base (250 total):
- Premium: 62 customers (25%)
- Free: 62 customers (25%)
- Family: 63 customers (25%)
- Student: 63 customers (25%)

Before Fairness Floor:
- Premium: 40 treated (65%) ‚Üê SKEWED toward high-value
- Free: 2 treated (3%) ‚Üê IGNORED
- Family: 1 treated (2%) ‚Üê IGNORED
- Student: 7 treated (11%)
Total: 50 customers treated
‚ùå Bias: 94% of outreach goes to Premium/Student

After 15% Fairness Floor:
- Premium: 30 treated (48%)
- Free: 10 treated (16%) ‚Üê MINIMUM MET ‚úì
- Family: 10 treated (16%) ‚Üê MINIMUM MET ‚úì
- Student: 14 treated (22%)
Total: 64 customers treated
‚úÖ Fair: All segments receive minimum coverage
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Regulatory compliance:** Ensures fair treatment (GDPR, anti-discrimination)
- **Brand equity:** Prevents perception of "abandoned" customer segments
- **Long-term strategy:** Maintains relationship with entire customer base
- **Prevents churn cascades:** Ignoring Free users can cause negative word-of-mouth

## Competitive Advantages Over Rule-Based Approaches

| Approach | Method | Outcome |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Rule-Based** | "Email all customers with >50% churn risk" | Ignores budget, capacity, ROI; treats everyone equally |
| **Greedy Heuristic** | "Contact customers by descending CLV" | Ignores fairness, diversity; may violate constraints |
| **This Model (MILP)** | Mathematical optimization with 6 constraint types | **Proven optimal**, respects all limits, balanced & fair |

**Key Differentiator:**  
The model doesn't just rank customers‚Äîit finds the **globally optimal allocation** across all customers, actions, and constraints simultaneously.

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Fairness by Design
The **Fairness Coverage Floor** constraint explicitly addresses algorithmic bias:
- Prevents "redlining" where low-value segments are ignored
- Ensures equitable treatment across demographics
- Maintains brand trust across entire customer base

### Transparency
- All constraints are explainable and adjustable
- Shadow prices reveal which constraints are limiting
- Managers can adjust parameters based on strategic priorities

### Human Oversight
- Model provides recommendations, not autopilot
- Managers review and approve plans before execution
- 10% holdout groups enable measurement of actual impact

---

## Academic Rigor

### Optimization Theory
- **Problem Class:** NP-hard mixed-integer linear program
- **Solution Method:** Branch-and-cut with LP relaxation
- **Optimality:** Proven optimal (not approximate or heuristic)
- **Complexity:** O(2^n) worst-case, polynomial average-case with modern solvers

### References to INFORMS 2024
