        "This notebook presents the complete prescriptive optimization analysis for PlaylistPro's weekly customer retention campaign. Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with Gurobi solver, we identify optimal customer-action assignments that maximize retained customer lifetime value while respecting operational, policy, and ethical constraints.\n",

        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "- **Optimal Budget Range:** $150-$250 weekly (400%+ ROI with strong coverage)\n",
        "- **Model Scale:** 2,000 binary decision variables (250 customers × 8 actions)\n",
        "- **Solution Quality:** Proven optimal (0.0% gap) in <3 seconds\n",
        "- **Coverage:** 60-70% of at-risk customers with balanced, fair campaigns\n",
        "- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Budget tested from $150 to $1,000, showing diminishing returns beyond $400\n",
