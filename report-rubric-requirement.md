DSCI 726	Prescriptive Analysis	 Operational Analytics		Rubric

The Prescriptive Analysis results are another work-in-progress memorandum. Just as with previous deliverables, your purpose is to keep your supervision chain-of-command up to date with your progress. Do not include your descriptive analytics work or the predictive results in your prescriptive analysis.
Integrate the three (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive results) in your final results. Instead, simply refer to your earlier work when necessary. Do not reproduce what you have already done. The prescriptive analysis will identify an optimal configuration for your predictive results. Your memorandum will comprise:
Prescriptive results
1.	Decision variables chosen (e.g. product quantity amounts, merchandise items to ship to, liquids in a product mix)
a.	Variable type (binary, integer, real)
b.	Identify any upper or lower bounds on the decision variables
2.	Constraints
a.	less than or equal (maximize the objective)
b.	greater than or equal (minimize the objective)
c.	equality
d.	describe the constraints as a linear combination of the decision variables
e.	remove redundant constraints
3.	Objective (minimize or maximize)
a.	describe the objective function as a linear combination of the decision variables
4.	Sensitivity analysis
5.	Listing of method or methods tried
a.	Linear programming
b.	Non-linear programming
6.	Visualization of results (you must have visuals)
a.	Charts – use if possible (preferred to tables)
b.	Tables – use where charts do not work well
Address the implicit or explicit questions above, or explain why they do not apply.
Standard usage errors – the analysis deliverable must employ Standard English grammar and structure. Write your report using active voice. You may use the editorial ‘we’ if you prefer avoiding first person singular. If I find three or more errors, I shall return the analysis for correction.
I will evaluate your work using the following criteria:
•	Complexity: measures the document’s originality, knowledge, depth and understanding
•	Completeness: measures whether the document fulfills the requirements above
•	Organization: measures the document’s structural appropriateness for the material and whether it has been presented in a clear, understandable and logical manner
